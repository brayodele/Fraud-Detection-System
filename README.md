# Fraud-detection-system-
This project is a system design for predicting credit card fraud using various machine learning algorithms ranging from loistic regression, support  vector machine, Random Forest Classifiers, XGBoost Classifier andd Artificial neural Netwrok.
The fraud prediction system was later hosted on streamlit, build on the Artificial Neural Network as it has a better ROC_AUC score of the machine learning algorithms.
